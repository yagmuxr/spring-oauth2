# What is OAuth2?

OAuth2 (Open Authorization) is a widely-used authorization framework that allows applications to gain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It enables users to authorize third-party applications to access their resources without sharing their credentials (username and password). Here's a brief overview of how OAuth2 works and its key concepts:

## Key Concepts

1. **Resource Owner**: The user who authorizes an application to access their account.
2. **Client**: The application requesting access to the user's account. For example, an app trying to access a user's Google profile.
3. **Resource Server**: The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens. For example, Google's servers.
4. **Authorization Server**: The server that issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization. Often, this is the same server as the resource server.
5. **Access Token**: A token issued to the client by the authorization server, allowing it to access the resource owner's resources. This token has a limited lifetime and scope.
6. **Refresh Token**: A token used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.


## Benefits of OAuth2

- **Security**: Users don't need to share their credentials with third-party applications.
- **Granularity**: Access tokens can have scopes defining what resources the client can access.
- **Revocability**: Users can revoke access tokens at any time, removing the third-party application's access.


OAuth2 provides a secure and flexible way for applications to access user data across different services without compromising user credentials. It is an essential protocol for modern web and mobile applications, enabling seamless and secure user experiences.
